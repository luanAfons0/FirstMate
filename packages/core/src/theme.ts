/**
 * The one look every page FirstMate writes shares: the colours, dark and
 * light, the radii, the three state shapes and the icons.
 *
 * It lives in `core` because two packages write pages and neither may serve
 * the other's: the Host writes the Index Page, and the App writes the strip,
 * the switcher and the Settings View as data addresses the Host never serves
 * (ADR-0008). Both take the same words from here and put them inside their
 * own page, so no page loads anything from outside itself.
 *
 * The system chooses the theme through `prefers-color-scheme`: dark is the
 * default, and light replaces each colour, never the names. One radius rule
 * holds: 6 px on a control, 8 px on a panel or a group, 10 px on a window.
 *
 * The icons are Phosphor glyphs (MIT), written once into each page as one
 * SVG sprite and drawn with `<use>`, because the App's pages load nothing and
 * the Index Page ships no assets of its own.
